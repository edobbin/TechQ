Project Path and File Structure for Skeleton Code:

Project Path for Building "TechQ" Web Application:

1. Setup Environment:

	Prepare our development environment with Node.js and create a new project directory.

2. Create File Structure:

	Establish the file structure for our project, including the following key files and directories:
	Create the "index.html" file to define the main page structure.
	Develop the "styles.css" file for styling our web pages.
	Build the "index.js" file to handle user interactions.
	Set up the "App.js" (or equivalent) to contain the core application logic.

3. Design the User Interface (UI):

	Design and implement the user interface in "index.html." Include placeholders for user registration, login forms, and user profile 	components. Create a visual layout that allows users to create accounts and log in.

4. Style the User Interface:

	Use the "styles.css" file to define the visual presentation of our UI. Apply CSS rules to enhance the look and feel of the 	registration and login forms, as well as the home page.

5. Set Up Firebase:

	Configure Firebase for our project by creating a Firebase project in the Firebase Console. Obtain the Firebase configuration 	settings, including API keys, and place them in the "firebaseConfig.js" file.

6. Implement User Registration:

	Write JavaScript code in "App.js" to enable user registration functionality. Use Firebase Authentication to allow users to create 	accounts.

7. Implement User Login:

	Extend our JavaScript code in "App.js" to include user login functionality. Users should be able to log in securely using their 	registered credentials.

8. User Authentication and Security:

	Leverage Firebase Authentication for user security. Ensure that only registered users can access specific parts of the application 	and protect sensitive data.

9. User Profile Page:

	Create the user profile page in "index.html" and define the visual elements that display user information.

10. Profile Data Management:

	In "App.js," implement functionality for users to manage their profiles, such as updating profile information, including profile 	pictures, and managing other profile-related data.

11. User Logout:

	Develop the capability for users to log out securely, terminating their session and protecting their data.

12. Testing and Debugging:

	Thoroughly test the registration, login, and profile management features. Identify and fix any issues, such as validation errors, 	authentication problems, or UI glitches.

13. Optimize User Experience:

	Optimize our user interface for a seamless user experience. Ensure that the registration, login, and profile creation processes 	are intuitive and error-free.

14. Refine Styling:

	Fine-tune the styling of our web pages for a polished and professional appearance.

15. Deployment and Hosting:

	Consider deploying our web application to a hosting service or server for public access. Firebase Hosting is an option if we are 	using Firebase for our project.



File Structure

Frontend (Client-Side):

1. index.html:
   - Main Web Page: Defines the layout of the main page, including spaces for content and scripts.

2. styles.css:
   - Style Rules: Contains rules for enhancing the visual appearance of web pages, such as fonts, colors, and layouts.

3. index.js:
   - Entry Logic: Manages interactions between the user interface and the behind-the-scenes operations.

4. App.js (or equivalent):
   - Core Logic: Controls how the web page looks and behaves, including handling user actions and connecting to the Firebase server for data.



Backend (Server-Side):

As Firebase serves both the database and user authentication, we won't need a traditional server here.

Firebase Configuration:

firebaseConfig.js (or equivalent):
   - Firebase Settings: Stores the configuration details for connecting to Firebase, ensuring the app can communicate with your Firebase project.

Other Files (as needed):
 package.json:
   - Project Dependencies: Lists the required software packages for your project, like Node.js and React, to keep everything running smoothly.

Authentication and Security (for user registration and login):

Authentication and security are managed by Firebase, which securely handles user registration and login functions.
